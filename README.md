# Starter Kit
###### by Jessica Felts

Use this blank project to kickstart your next website!

#### Includes:

**index.html** file
+ meta information
+ blank title
+ link to normalize.css cdn
+ link to main.css file
 
**main.css** file
+ global styles to make your life easier
+ main-container styling to get you started
+ a mobile-first media query setup

#### Media Queries:

Mobile-first optimized media queries allow for 11 break-points, and one additional query for screens smaller than the first breakpoint. Developers will not need to use _every_ breakpoint for _every_ project, but these have been provided to give the Developer a better understanding of popular screen sizes. _(The sizes have been determined with help from Chrome Developer Tools and general knowledge of popular Monitor Resolutions)_
